The error is due to a missing colon at the end of line 1 in your Python file which seems like it's not following standard python syntax rules for indentation and new lines, hence causing SyntaxError with "invalid syntax". Here are few solutions you can try based on my understanding from what I see:

Solution - Change Line (Python Indented Block)
```python
import logging  # missing a colon at the end of this line. Should be `logging.:`   --> : is not Python reserved character, should remove or fix it if needed to make syntax correct later on in your code block. This has been added as per standard python indentation rules for blocks like while/for loops etc., 

# rest of the line...(missing colon) - this will raise SyntaxError with invalid syntax error too, so not fixed here unless it's a typo or some other issue in your code. But you should make sure to fix that if possible due to its nature and purpose (logging module). If missing then add one at the end of line as per standard Python indentation rules for blocks such as import statements etc, assuming they are not errors by now since we already added logger setup above which is in a correct way. 

```python   - should be `import logging:` instead if you want to create an alias or use the module's functionality more easily then removing colon after "logging". In this case removed as it does nothing, but might cause confusion when people are reading your code later on due understanding of what a import statement is.
   - Also remember `if __name__ =="__main__":` should be the first line in every python file and must exist at all times because if this part runs without an interpreter being present, it will not run as expected leading to error saying that 'module' object has no attribute'. This is a common misunderstanding when starting programming.
   - Lastly remember Python Syntax should always be consistent with indentation and new line rules which are defined by PEP 8 (Python style guide). If you miss any rule, it will result into an error so please follow them if not already followed in your code blocks or scripts. This is because correct coding follows the same convention as other humans do when writing codes for different programming languages too and leads to better maintenance of projects over time since errors won't occur until run-time unless there are syntax issues found during its execution which can be hard on debugging later if you don’t know where exactly it happened.
